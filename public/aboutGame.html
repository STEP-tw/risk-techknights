          <h2>Game Board</h2>

          <img src="/images/board.png" class="board-img" />

          <p>
            The game board is a map of 6 continents divided into 42 territories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each continent is a different color and exists of 4 to 12
            territories.
          </p>

          <p>
            The numbers along the bottom (southern) edge of the board indicate
            the number of armies you will receive for a set of cards you trade
            in.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h2>Cards</h2>

            style="width:350px;height:200px;border:1px solid black"
          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                42 Cards are marked with a territory and a picture of Infantry,
                Cavalry, or Artillery.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Two "wild" cards marked with all three pictures, but no
                territory.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                12 Secret Mission cards used only in Secret Mission Risk.
              </p>

              <p>
                These cards are only used in the secret mission variation, else
                you have to remove them.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />
          <h2>Object of the Game</h2>

          <p>
            To conquer the world by occupying all territories on the board. You
            need to eliminate all your opponents.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h2>Setup</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Select a color and, depending on the number of players, count
                out the "armies" you'll need to start the game.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If 3 are playing, each player counts out 35 Infantry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If 4 are playing, each player counts out 30 Infantry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If 5 are playing, each player counts out 25 Infantry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If 6 are playing, each player counts out 20 Infantry.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Roll one die. Whoever rolls the highest number takes one
                Infantry piece from his or her pile and places it onto any
                territory on the board, thus claiming that territory.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Starting to the left of the first player, in turn, everyone
                places one army onto any unoccupied territory. Continue until
                all 42 territories have been claimed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                After all 42 territories are claimed, each player in turn places
                one additional army onto any territory he or she already
                occupies.
              </p>

              <p>
                Continue in this way until everyone has run out of armies. There
                is no limit to the number of armies you may place onto a single
                territory.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Shuffle the pack of RISK cards (maybe, remove the Mission cards)
                and place the cards face down by the side of the board.
              </p>

              <p>This pack forms the draw pile.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Whoever placed the first army opens the game.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <br />
          <h2>Game Play</h2>

          <p>
            On your turn, try to capture territories by defeating your
            opponents' armies. But be careful: Winning battles will depend on
            careful planning, quick decisions, and bold moves.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will have to place your forces wisely, attack at just the right
            time and fortify your defenses against all enemies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> At any time during the game, you may trade in Infantry
            pieces for the equivalent in Cavalry or Artillery if you need to, or
            wish to.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of your turns consists of three steps, in this order:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Getting and placing new armies.</li>
            <li>Attacking.</li>
            <li>Fortifying your position.</li>
          </ol>

          <br />
          <h2>I. Placing New Armies</h2>

          <p>
            At the beginning of each turn, calculate how many new armies you can
            add to your territories based on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The number of territories you occupy.</li>
            <li>The value of the continents you control.</li>
            <li>
              The value of the matched sets of RISK cards you trade in.
            </li>
            <li>The specific territory pictured on a traded-in card.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Territories</h3>

          <p>
            At the beginning of every turn (including your first), count the
            number of territories you currently occupy, then divide the total by
            three (ignore any fraction). The answer is the number of armies you
            receive. Place the new armies on any territory you already occupy.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Example:</i> 11 territories = 3 armies, 14 territories = 4
            armies, 17 territories = 5 armies. You will always receive at least
            3 armies on a turn, even if you occupy fewer than 9 territories.
          </p>

          <h3>Continents</h3>

          <p>
            In addition, at the beginning of your turn, you will receive armies
            for each continent you control. (To control a continent, you must
            occupy all its territories at the start of your turn).
          </p>

          <p>
            The number of extra armies is different for each continent:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Asia: 7</li>
            <li>Nort America: 5</li>
            <li>Europe: 5</li>
            <li>Africa: 3</li>
            <li>South America: 2</li>
            <li>Australia: 2</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These numbers can be different depending on the version of Risk you
            are playing. To find the exact number of armies, look at the chart
            in the lower left-hand corner of the game board.
          </p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <br />
          <h2>Risk Cards</h2>

          <h3>Earning Cards</h3>

          <p>
            At the end of any turn in which you have captured at least one
            territory, you will earn one (and only one) RISK card.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are trying to collect sets of 3 cards in any of the following
            combinations: 3 cards of the same design (Infantry, Cavalry, or
            Artillery), 1 each of 3 designs, or any 2 plus a "wild" card.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have collected a set of 3 RISK cards, you may turn them in at
            the start of your next turn, or you may wait. But if you have 5 or 6
            cards at the beginning of your turn, you must trade in at least one
            set and may trade in a second set if you have one.
          </p>

          <h3>Trading in Cards for Armies</h3>

          <p>
            At the beginning of subsequent turns, you may trade in matched sets
            of cards and take additional armies based on the total number of
            sets anyone has traded in so far. For quick reference, keep
            traded-in cards face down under the bottom edge of the game board to
            mark the value (in armies) of the next trade.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the sixth set has been traded in, each additional set is worth
            5 more armies. Example: If you trade in the seventh set, you get 20
            armies; if you trade in the eighth, you get 25 armies, and so on.
            "First" and "second" set, etc., refer to sets traded in by anyone
            during the game. Thus, if you trade in the 3rd set in the game, you
            receive 8 armies, even if itis the first set you have traded in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Occupied territories: If any of the 3 cards you trade in shows the
            picture of a territory you occupy, you receive 2 extra armies. You
            must place both those armies onto that particular territory.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Note:</i> On a single turn, you may receive no more than 2 extra
            armies above and beyond those you receive for the matched sets of
            cards you trade in.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> No matter how many armies you receive at the start of
            your turn, deploy them carefully-either to prepare for an attack or
            to defend against one. It is a an excellent military strategy to
            move your armies to the front, heavily fortifying territories that
            border enemy territories.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h2>II. Attacking</h2>

          <p>
            After placing your armies at the beginning of your turn, decide if
            you wish to attack at this time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The object of an attack is to capture a territory by defeating all
            the opposing armies already on it. The battle is fought by a roll of
            the dice. Study the board for a moment. Do you want to attack?
          </p>

          <p>
            If you choose not to attack, pass the dice to the player on your
            left. You may still fortify your position if you wish. If you decide
            to attack, you must follow these rules:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                You may only attack a territory that's adjacent (touching) to
                one of your own, or connected to it by a dashed line. Examples:
                Greenland may attack the Northwest Territory, Ontario, Quebec,
                and Iceland. North Africa may attack Egypt, Western Europe, and
                Brazil. At the western and eastern edges of the board, Alaska is
                considered adjacent to and may attack, Kamchatka.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                You must always have at least two armies in the territory you're
                attacking from.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                You may continue attacking one territory until you have
                eliminated all armies on it, or you may shift your attack from
                one territory to another, attacking each as often as you want
                and attacking as many territories as you like during one turn.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <h3>To Attack</h3>

          <img
            src="/images/dice.jpg"
            style="width:350px;height:200px;border:1px solid black"
          />

          <p>
            First, announce both the territory you're attacking and the one you
            are attacking from. Then roll the dice against the opponent who
            occupies the opposing territory.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Before rolling, both you and your opponent must announce the
                number of dice you intend to roll, and you both must roll at the
                same time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You, the attacker, will roll 1, 2 or 3 red dice: You must have
                at least one more army in your territory than the number of dice
                you roll.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Hint:</b> The more dice you roll, the higher your odds of
                winning. Yet the more dice you roll, the more armies you may
                lose, or be required to move into a captured territory.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The defender will roll either 1 or 2 white dice: To roll 2 dice,
                he or she must have at least 2 armies on the territory under
                attack. Hint: The more dice the defender rolls, the higher his
                or her odds of winning, but the more armies he or she may lose.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <h3>To Decide A Battle</h3>

          <p>
            Compare the highest die each of you rolled. If yours (the attackers)
            is higher, the defender loses one army from the territory under
            attack.
          </p>

          <p>
            But if the defender's die is higher than yours, you lose one army
            from the territory you attacked from; put it back in your clear
            plastic box.
          </p>

          <p>
            If each of you rolled more than one die, now compare the two
            next-highest dice and repeat the process.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/example.gif"
            style="width:350px;height:200px;border:1px
              solid black"
          /><br />

          <br />

          <br />
          <h2>III. Fortifying Your Position</h2>

          <p>
            No matter what you have done on your turn, you may end your turn by
            fortifying your position.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are not required to win a battle or even to try an attack to do
            so.
          </p>

          <p>Some players refer to this as the "free move".</p>

          <p>
            To fortify your position, move as many armies as you would like from
            one (and only one) of your territories into one (and only one) of
            your adjacent territories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember to move troops towards borders where they can help in an
            attack and leave at least one army behind.
          </p>

          <br />
          <h2>End of the Game</h2>

          <p>
            The winner is the first player to eliminate every opponent by
            capturing all 42 territories on the board.
